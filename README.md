# IDFC Alternative Underwriting & AVM Prototype

A comprehensive demonstration of IDFC's innovative alternative underwriting and automated property valuation system for affordable mortgage loans.

## üéØ Project Overview

This prototype demonstrates three core innovations:
1. **Alternative Data Underwriting** - Risk assessment using UPI transactions, utility payments, and digital behavior
2. **Automated Valuation Model (AVM)** - AI-powered property valuation using circle rates, geo-data, and comparables
3. **Multi-stakeholder Platform** - Interfaces for consumers, loan officers, and field agents

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Consumer View** (Mobile-first): Property submission, consent flow, valuation results
- **Loan Officer Dashboard** (Desktop): Application pipeline, risk analysis, decision tools
- **Field Agent Interface** (Mobile): Lead management, property verification, earnings tracking

### Core Features
- Real-time risk scoring with SHAP explainability
- Property valuation with confidence intervals
- Account Aggregator (AA) consent simulation
- Audit trail and compliance tracking
- Responsive design across all devices
